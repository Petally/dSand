# dSand
## A falling sand game, on the browser
dSand is a falling sand game, that I'm making as a simple supplementary personal project to my web-dev self-study. It'll function ideally as a falling sand game, with extra elements not typically seen in other sand games that often, such as advanced physics, player movement, etc. I want to make my own sand game with my own art direction, so I can play my very own ideal sand game! If you like it as well, then that's just fantastic.

## Planned features
This is not exactly a roadmap, however some key features I intend on implementing at some point are:
- Gravity, velocity
- Particle physics, particles can get flung into the air, etc
- Player character object, for obbies and whatnot
- Possible level sharing system thru a web server
- Highly complex emergent behaviour
- Cute art-style
These features are the ones I see as the most enticing, and I will keep this list even if I do finish the features.
